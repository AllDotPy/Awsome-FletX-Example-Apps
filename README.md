# 🚀 Awesome FletX & Flet Apps

A curated collection of awesome apps, tools, and experiments built using [Flet](https://flet.dev) and [FletX](https://github.com/AllDotPy/FletX) — frameworks that allow you to build beautiful UIs in Python (or other backends) without writing frontend code.

## 💡 What is Flet / FletX?

- **Flet** is a framework that enables developers to create web, desktop, and mobile apps using only Python (or Dart), leveraging Flutter under the hood — no HTML, CSS, or JS required.
- **FletX** builds upon Flet, is a lightweight yet powerful framework that brings structured reactivity and clean architecture to Flet apps. It introduces controllers, services, and routers to help you separate logic, state, and UI with ease.

> These tools are perfect for developers who want to prototype or build production-ready apps without diving into frontend technologies.

## 🌟 Why This Repo?

To inspire, learn, and showcase the creative potential of building full-featured apps with only backend code. No frontend hassle. Just Python magic.
